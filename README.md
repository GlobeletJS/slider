# slider

Set up interactive menus sliding over a main content DIV.

The target use case is for a map interface. Checkout the [simple demo]!

[simple demo]: https://globeletjs.github.io/slider/index.html

slider can set up two types of menus on the map DIV:
- Settings menu: slides in from the left, overlaying all other content
- Feature info menu: slides in from the right (landscape screen) or bottom
  (mobile screen in portrait mode). This also shifts the map while sliding, to
  (hopefully) keep the selected feature in view.
